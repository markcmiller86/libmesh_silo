<h2 class="chapter">1 The Browser Command Line</h2>

<p>The schnauzer is a small terrier with a wiry coat; the browser is a
utility built on Silo for reading scientific database files.  The
browser command line is

   <p><code>browser</code> <b>[</b><var>switches</var><b>]</b> <b>[</b><code>--</code><b>]</b>
<b>[</b><var>files</var><b>]...</b>

   <p>The browser recognizes the following command line switches.  Single
letter switches that don't require an argument can be grouped together
(so &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-l -q</span></samp>&rsquo; is the same as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-lq</span></samp>&rsquo;). When a single-letter switch
takes an argument the argument can appear either immediately after the
letter or as the next argument such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-l3</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-l 3</span></samp>&rsquo;. Long
format switches are introduced by double hyphens and if they take an
argument it must follow an equal sign such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--eval=exit</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Command-line options take effect before the initialization file is read,
but also override any settings made in that file.

   <p>Invoking the browser with the switch &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--help</span></samp>&rsquo; will show a complete
list of command-line switches and their descriptions.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-A </code><var>tolerance</var><dt><code>--absolute=</code><var>tolerance</var><dd>All absolute differencing tolerances are set to <var>tolerance</var>, a
floating point number. All variables of the form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$diff_*_abs</span></samp>&rsquo; are
set to the specified tolerance.

     <br><dt><code>-R </code><var>tolerance</var><dt><code>--absolute=</code><var>tolerance</var><dd>All relative differencing tolerances are set to <var>tolerance</var>, a
floating point number.  All variables of the form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$diff_*_rel</span></samp>&rsquo; are
set to the specified tolerance.

     <br><dt><code>-V</code><dt><code>--version</code><dd>Prints the browser version number. If no other switches or files are
specified then the browser will exit after printing the version number.

     <br><dt><code>-d </code><var>words</var><dt><code>--diff=</code><var>words</var><dd>This switch controls the behavior of the <code>diff</code> function of the
browser. The <var>words</var> should be a comma-separated list of key words
which will be assigned to the <code>$diff</code> browser variable. See its
documentation for details.

     <br><dt><code>-e </code><var>expression</var><dt><code>--eval=</code><var>expression</var><dd>The browser expression is evaluated and the result is printed on the
standard output stream.  More than one expression can be given to the
browser by using multiple switches.  The expressions will be evaluated
in the order given after the initialization file is read.  When a
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-e</span></samp>&rsquo; switch is present the browser exits after all expressions are
processed instead of going into interactive mode. If standard output is
a terminal then the browser pages the output in the normal way (see
below).  If the interrupt character is pressed when an expression is
being evaluated, the browser aborts<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

     <br><dt><code>-E </code><var>list</var><dt><code>--exclude=</code><var>list</var><dd>The browser <code>$exclude</code> variable is set to the comma-separated list
of names and/or datatypes supplied as an argument to this switch. The
switch may appear more than once. The names in the <code>$exclude</code> list
will be excluded from recursive <code>diff</code> operations. See
documentation for <code>$exclude</code> for details.

     <br><dt><code>-f </code><var>initfile</var><dt><code>--file=</code><var>initfile</var><dd>When the browser begins execution it attempts to read the file
<samp><span class="file">.browser_rc</span></samp> in the user's home directory.  If that file isn't
readable then it tries to read a system-wide browser initialization
file.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-f</span></samp>&rsquo; command line switch causes the browser to try to
read the specified file instead.  To prevent the browser from reading
any initialization file, say &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-f /dev/null</span></samp>&rsquo; (internal browser
variables are still initialized to default values).  The initialization
file is opened after the database(s) and therefore can contain commands
that reference the database(s).

     <br><dt><code>-h</code><dt><code>--help</code><dd>Prints a browser usage message. If this is the only switch and no file
names are specified then the browser will exit after showing the usage
message.  The usage message will be paged if printed to a terminal.

     <br><dt><code>-l </code><b>[</b><var>value</var><b>]</b><dt><code>--lowlevel</code><b>[</b><code>=</code><var>value</var><b>]</b><dd>This switch assigns an integer value to the <code>$lowlevel</code> browser
variable, which causes the browser to load database objects as type
<code>DBobject</code> even if the object is some other composite Silo datatype
like <code>DBquadvar</code>. If <var>value</var> is specified then it will be
assigned to the <code>$lowlevel</code> variable; otherwise the value &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>&rsquo;
is assigned.

     <br><dt><code>-c </code><b>[</b><var>value</var><b>]</b><dt><code>--checksums</code><b>[</b><code>=</code><var>value</var><b>]</b><dd>This switch assigns an integer value to the <code>$checksums</code> browser
variable, which controls browser's use of checksums during read.

     <br><dt><code>-n </code><var>lines</var><dt><code>--height=</code><var>lines</var><dd>The browser pages interactive output to prevent it from scrolling off
the top of the screen. It normally decides how tall the window is by
making <code>ioctl</code> calls, but this switch can be used to override that
choice. The setting is valid only until the browser receives a
<code>SIGWINCH</code> signal and queries the terminal size.

     <br><dt><code>-q</code><dt><code>--quiet</code><dd>This option causes the browser to be less verbose than normal. This sets
the <code>$verbosity</code> variable to zero.

     <br><dt><code>-o</code><dt><code>--obase=</code><var>format</var><dd>This switch sets the internal variable <code>$obase</code> to <var>format</var>,
which should be &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">16</span></samp>&rsquo; for hexadecimal, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">8</span></samp>&rsquo; for octal, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2</span></samp>&rsquo;
for binary, or anything else for the default decimal format. It controls
how integer, floating-point, character, and string data are
displayed. The default is that these types of data are displayed with a
type-dependent <code>printf</code> format string which is user defined (e.g.,
<code>$fmt_int</code>).

     <br><dt><code>-r </code><b>[</b><var>boolean</var><b>]</b><dt><code>--rdonly</code><b>[</b><code>=</code><var>boolean</var><b>]</b><dd>This option assigns a boolean value to the <code>$rdonly</code> browser
variable, which causes the browser to open all subsequent files in
read-only mode. Files that only have Unix read permission are always
opened in read-only mode, but the browser issues a warning if the user
had asked for read-write permission.  If no argument is given for this
switch then true is assumed. The default if this switch does not appear
is false.

     <br><dt><code>-s </code><b>[</b><var>boolean</var><b>]</b><dt><code>--single</code><b>[</b><code>=</code><var>boolean</var><b>]</b><dd>This option causes the browser to call <code>DBForceSingle</code> with a value
of one or zero depending on whether the argument is true or false. If no
argument is given then it is assumed to be true.  Calling
<code>DBForceSingle</code> with a non-zero value causes most drivers to return
floating point data with the C <code>float</code> type rather than the default
<code>double</code> type.

     <br><dt><code>-v</code><dt><code>--verbose</code><dd>This option causes the browser to be more verbose than normal. This sets
the <code>$verbosity</code> variable to two.

     <br><dt><code>-w </code><var>columns</var><dt><code>--width=</code><var>columns</var><dd>The browser normally breaks lines to prevent them from wrapping around
from the right margin to the next line. It decides how many columns are
appropriate by making <code>ioctl</code> calls, but this switch overrides that
choice.

     <br><dt><code>--debug</code><b>[</b><code>=</code><var>boolean</var><b>]</b><dd>Tells Silo to display the names of the Silo API functions as they are
called. This switch is probably only useful to those who debug the browser.

   </dl>

   <p>If Silo database file names are specified then the files are opened in
the order specified and associated with file symbols <code>$1</code>,
<code>$2</code>, etc. These are opened before the initialization file is read,
which happens before any <code>--eval</code> statements are executed. However,
the command-line options are reevaluated after the initialization file
is read.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Command Syntax</h2>

<p>The browser command syntax is quite simple, consisting of function
calls, operators, atoms, and lists. Comments begin with a hash mark and
continue to the end of the line (except in strings). White space is
generally ignored except as a token separator. Statements can be
continued across multiple lines, but a backslash must escape the
linefeed if the partial statement looks syntactically complete.

   <p>A function call is a parenthetical expression where the first element is
the name of the function and the subsequent elements are the arguments
to that function.  Most functions evaluate all their arguments but
others evaluate only some (or none). For example, the <code>Assign</code>
function doesn't evaluate its first argument, but rather assignes the
evaluated second argument to the l-value specified by the first
argument. The parentheses can be omitted from around the top-level
function call. Say &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">help func</span></samp>&rsquo; (or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(help func)</span></samp>&rsquo;) for a list
of all functions.

   <p>Most browser operators are infix, binary operators. They take two
operands, one on each side of the operator, and call some function which
is bound to the operator. For example the expression &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo=1</span></samp>&rsquo; is
equivalent to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(Assign foo 1)</span></samp>&rsquo;. The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">{}</span></samp>&rsquo; operator takes any
number of arguments which appear between the open and close curly
braces. Say &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">help operators</span></samp>&rsquo; for a list of all operators.

   <p>The browser has three types of atoms: strings, numbers, and symbols. A
string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double
quotes. The normal C escaping mechanism can be used for special
characters within the string. A single quote has no special significance
in a double-quoted string and vice versa.  Numbers are positive or
negative sequences of decimal digits with an optional embedded decimal
point and trailing exponent. An exponent consists of the letter `e' or
`E' followed by an optional sign and one or more decimal digits.  A
symbol is any sequence of alphanumeric characters and may also include
dollar signs, hyphens, underscores, and various other characters
(although their use is discouraged).

   <p>A list consists of zero or more atoms or lists enclosed in
parentheses. Evaluation of the list results in the browser looking up
the functional value of the first member of the list and calling that
function with the subsequent list members as arguments. Evaluation of
the list can be suppressed by using curly braces instead of parentheses
(e.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">{1 3 5}</span></samp>&rsquo; is equivalent to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(Quote 1 3 5)')</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The browser reads commands interactively from its standard input. If
available, the GNU readline library is used allowing the user to edit
commands as they are entered using Emacs or vi editing commands. To
quote from the readline library (documentation is available at
<samp><span class="file">http://www.cs.utah.edu/csinfo/texinfo/texinfo.html</span></samp>):

   <blockquote>
Often during an interactive session you type in a long line of text,
only to notice that the first word on the line is misspelled.  The
Readline library gives you a set of commands for manipulating the text
as you type it in, allowing you to just fix your typo, and not forcing
you to retype the majority of the line.  Using these editing commands,
you move the cursor to the place that needs correction, and delete or
insert the text of the corrections.  Then, when you are satisfied with
the line, you simply press &lt;RETURN&gt;.  You do not have to be at the
end of the line to press &lt;RETURN&gt;; the entire line is accepted
regardless of the location of the cursor within the line. 
</blockquote>

   <p>The readline library default mode is Emacs.  If you prefer <code>vi</code> key
bindings, then create a file called <samp><span class="file">.inputrc</span></samp> in your home
directory with the single line &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set editing-mode vi</span></samp>&rsquo;.

<h2 class="chapter">3 Builtin Functions</h2>

<p>Some of the browser functions have more than one form and are overloaded
to do various things depending on the number of actual arguments
supplied. Arguments shown between &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo; are optional.

     <dl>
<dt><code>array </code><var>dimensions</var> <b>...</b> <var>basetype</var><dd>Creates a new array datatype. The arguments are the size of the array in
each dimension and the datatype of the array elements. The array size
arguments can be either integers or strings that look like comma- and/or
space-separated integers. Browser arrays use C element ordering.

     <br><dt><code>cd </code><var>dirname</var> <b>[</b><var>filesym</var><b>]</b><dd>Each file has a current working directory (CWD) which is initially set
to the root directory (<samp><span class="file">/</span></samp>). This command will set the CWD to some
other directory. The first argument is the name of the new CWD. If the
name contains special characters it should be enclosed in quotes to
protect it from the parser. If the name is relative (doesn't start with
a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo;) then the name is looked up with respect to the current
CWD. The second optional argument is the file or list of files whose CWD
is being set (default is the file represented by the browser variable
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$1</span></samp>&rsquo;).  The <var>dirname</var> is a string; it is not interpreted by the
browser and thus a command like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cd $1.domain_0.angle_walls</span></samp>&rsquo; will
fail while &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cd domain_0/angle_walls $1</span></samp>&rsquo; would work.

     <br><dt><code>close </code><var>filesym</var> <b>...</b><dd>Closes the database files associated with the specified file symbols. 
If objects exist in the browser memory which are associated with the
database then the database will be held open until those objects no
longer exist, but the file symbol will be freed so another file can
immediately be associated with that symbol. This command is equivalent
to &lsquo;<samp><var>filesym</var><span class="samp">=nil</span></samp>&rsquo; (except with extra sanity checks).

     <br><dt><code>diff </code><var>objects...</var><dd>Calculates the differences between its arguments similar to the Unix
<code>diff</code> command. If called with an even number of arguments the
argument list is split in half and each argument from the first half is
compared with the corresponding argument of the second half. If called
with no arguments then the argument list will be the SILO files from the
command-line (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$1</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$2</span></samp>&rsquo;, <i>etc.</i>).  If called with just one
argument which is an object from the silo file &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$1</span></samp>&rsquo; then that
object will be compared to an object with the same name from file
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$2</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The behavior is influenced by the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$diff</span></samp>&rsquo; browser
variable. In general, if no differences are found then no output is
produced.

     <br><dt><code>end</code><dd>See <code>exit</code>.

     <br><dt><code>exit </code><b>[</b><var>status</var><b>]</b><dd>Exits the browser with the specified <var>status</var>, an integer constant. 
If no exit status is supplied then zero (success) is assumed. Typing the
end of file character (usually control-d) at the beginning of a line
also invokes this command, causing a zero (success) exit.

     <br><dt><code>file </code><var>filename</var><dd>The Silo database <var>filename</var> is opened and returned but not
associated with any symbol.  Therefore, as soon as nothing refers to the
file, it is closed.  One common use of this function is with the
<code>ls</code> or <code>diff</code> commands which can take file objects as
arguments.  For instance, the command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ls (file curv2d.pdb)</span></samp>&rsquo; opens
the <samp><span class="file">curv2d.pdb</span></samp> file and lists the root directory and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ls
(cd dirname (file curv2d.pdb))</span></samp>&rsquo; lists the contents of the <var>dirname</var>
directory of <samp><span class="file">curv2d.pdb</span></samp>.  The file is open for read-write mode
unless the <code>$rdonly</code> browser variable has a non-nil value or the
file has only read permission.

     <br><dt><code>help </code><b>[</b><var>topic</var><b>]</b> <b>[</b><var>docstring</var><b>]</b><dd>Shows documentation for various parts of the browser. When invoked
without arguments it will display a table of contents of <code>help</code>
subcommands. With one argument it will display documentation for a help
category (e.g., <code>help run</code>), a browser internal variable (e.g.,
<code>help $diff</code>), a function (e.g., <code>help diff</code>), a command-line
switch (e.g., <code>help --diff</code>), an operator (e.g., <code>help
"op="</code>), or the documentation string associated with the specified
symbol. When invoked with a string argument it will print all help
categories which contain the specified string (e.g., <code>help
"diff"</code>). When called with two arguments it assigns the second argument
as the documentation property of the first argument, which must be a
symbol or string.

     <br><dt><code>include </code><var>filename</var><dd>Causes the specified file to be parsed and evaluated. This is often
useful in user-private initialization files, <samp><span class="file">~/.browser_rc</span></samp>, where
the user wants to augment the actions that would normally happen in the
system-wide browser initialization file. The user-private file should
contain the line &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">include $pubinit</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>ls </code><b>[</b><var>filesym</var><b>]</b> <b>[</b><var>objnames</var><b>...]</b><dd>This command lists the contents of the current working directory.  If no
file is specified then the file associated with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$1</span></samp>&rsquo; is used. If a
list of files is specified (e.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$*</span></samp>&rsquo;) then a listing is produced
for each of those files. If object names are supplied, then only those
objects are listed.  The object names can include the normal Unix
filename wild cards &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[]</span></samp>&rsquo; (object names with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[]</span></samp>&rsquo; wild cards require quotes so the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo; are not
intrepretted as array selectors). Wild card matching is not available if
the <code>fnmatch</code> function was not available when the browser was
compiled.  If a single object name is supplied and that object is a
directory, then the contents of that directory appear.  An alternative
(and shorter) way to list the contents of a subdirectory is to type the
name of the subdirectory on a line by itself (for instance,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">dir1</span></samp>&rsquo;).

     <br><dt><dd>Another way to list a directory is to just type the name of the
directory at the prompt (you can use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; as the current working
directory).  So saying &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$2.dir</span></samp>&rsquo; is the same as saying &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ls $2
dir</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$2..</span></samp>&rsquo; is the same as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ls $2</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ls $2 .</span></samp>&rsquo;.

<var>filesym</var> will be closed as soon as all objects associated with that
file are freed.  If <var>filesym</var> is omitted then &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$1</span></samp>&rsquo; is used. 
This command is equivalent to &lsquo;<samp><var>filesym</var><span class="samp"> =

<h2 class="chapter">4 Operators</h2>

<p>A browser expression is composed of terms and operators. The following
operators are supported and overloaded depending on the number and type
of arguments.

     <dl>
<dt><var>symbol </var><code>=</code><var> value</var><dd>Assigns a value to a browser internal variable or a database object.  If
<var>symbol</var> is an internal variable and <var>value</var> is the word
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">nil</span></samp>&rsquo; then the symbol loses its variable value.

     <br><dt><var>filesym </var><code>.</code><var> varname</var><dd>The variable or directory with the name <var>varname</var> is loaded from the
database associated with the specified file symbol and the Silo data
object is returned.  The variable name must be enclosed in quotes unless
it looks like a symbol and does not conflict with a browser internal
variable. If <var>filesym</var> is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$1</span></samp>&rsquo; and the variable name is not
enclosed in quotes and is not the name of an internal browser variable,
then the file symbol and dot can be omitted.  Thus &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$1.quadmesh</span></samp>&rsquo;
can be written as just &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">quadmesh</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><var>sdo </var><code>.</code><var> fieldname</var><dd>If <var>sdo</var> is some Silo data object which has a structured type, then
this expression returns a new Silo data object which is the specified
field of the <var>sdo</var> structure.  For instance, a quadmesh &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qm</span></samp>&rsquo;
has a field named &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">dims</span></samp>&rsquo; which holds the dimensions of the mesh. 
The expression &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qm.dims</span></samp>&rsquo; returns just the dimensions.

     <br><dt><var>list </var><code>.</code><var> anything</var><dd>If the first argument is a list then the dot operator is applied to each
member of the list and the result is a list of the results.

     <br><dt><var>sdo </var><code>[</code><var> elmtnum </var><code>]</code><dd>If <var>sdo</var> is some Silo data object which has an array type, then this
expression returns the single specified element of that array.  The
first element of an array is number zero.  For instance,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qm.dims[0]</span></samp>&rsquo; returns the size of the first mesh dimension.

     <br><dt><var>sdo </var><code>[</code><var> min </var><code>:</code><var> max </var><code>]</code><dd>If <var>sdo</var> is some Silo data object which has an array type, then this
expression returns a sub-array with elements <var>min</var> through
<var>max</var>, inclusive.  Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qm.dims[0:2]</span></samp>&rsquo; are the first three
mesh dimensions.

     <br><dt><var>sdo </var><code>[</code><var> expr1</var><code>,</code><var> expr2</var><code>,</code><var> ... </var><code>]</code><dd>If <var>sdo</var> is some Silo data object which has an array type, and
<var>expr</var> are element numbers or ranges, then one <var>expr</var> is applied
to each array dimension in turn, automatically skipping over pointers. 
For instance, if a quadvar &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qv</span></samp>&rsquo; has a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vals</span></samp>&rsquo; of type
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*[2] *[36000] float</span></samp>&rsquo; then the expression &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qv.vals[0,100:199]</span></samp>&rsquo;
will be an object consisting of the second 100 values of the first
variable.  (The expression &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qv.vals[0][100:199]</span></samp>&rsquo; would result in an
error message because &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">qv.vals[0]</span></samp>&rsquo; returns an object with the type
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[1] *[36000] float</span></samp>&rsquo; to which is then applied the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[100:199]</span></samp>&rsquo;
that is invalid because the array only has one element.)

     <br><dt><var>expr </var><code>|</code><var> command</var><dd>The expression <var>expr</var> has its output redirected to the shell
command <var>command</var>.

     <br><dt><var>expr </var><code>&gt;</code><var> file</var><dd>The expression <var>expr</var> has its output redirected to the file
<var>file</var>, which is created or truncated.

     <br><dt><var>expr </var><code>&gt;&gt;</code><var> file</var><dd>The expression <var>expr</var> has its output appended to the file
<var>file</var>, which is created if it doesn't exist.

     <br><dt><code>{</code><var> expressions </var><code>}</code><dd>This operator takes zero or more operands occurring between the curly
braces (optionally separated by commas) and returns a list of those
unevaluated operands. If only one operand is given then that operand is
returned unevluated and not in a list.

     <br><dt><var>minimum </var><code>:</code><var> maximum</var><dd>The range operator is used to construct a range object which represents
all integers between <var>minimum</var> and <var>maximum</var>, inclusive.

<h2 class="chapter">5 Internal Variables</h2>

<p>Certain aspects of the browser can be configured by setting browser
variables with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>&rsquo; operator described above.  The current value
of an internal variable can be displayed by typing the variable's name. 
The variables are initialized with default values when the browser
starts and may then be overridden by command-line options, the
initialization file, or interactively. All predefined browser variables
begin with a dollar sign.

<h3 class="section">5.1 Differencing Variables</h3>

<p>These variables affect the operation of the <code>diff</code> function.

     <dl>
<dt><code>$diff</code><dd>This variable's value is a list of symbols which control the details of
the <code>diff</code> function. The default is <code>$diff = {detail,
two_column}</code>. This variable is set by the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--diff</span></samp>&rsquo; command-line
switch.

          <dl>
<dt><code>detail</code><dd>This is the default, which causes the <code>diff</code> function to report all
details about detected differences.

          <br><dt><code>brief</code><dd>If this word is present then <code>diff</code> doesn't actually display any
data. The output will consist of a single line for each file object
which differs between file A and file B.  This option allows some
short circuiting of the work required for the <code>detail</code> mode.

          <br><dt><code>summary</code><dd>This key word causes <code>diff</code> to report by a single line of output
when the two operands of the <code>diff</code> function are different. No
output is produced if they are the same. This option allows some short
circuiting of the work required for the <code>brief</code> mode.

          <br><dt><code>ignore_additions</code><dd>If this is specified then <code>diff</code> will not report differences due to
data appearing in file B but not in file A.

          <br><dt><code>ignore_deletions</code><dd>If this is specified then <code>diff</code> will not report differences due to
data appearing in file A but not in file B.

          <br><dt><code>two_column</code><dd>If this is specified then the output will list differences side-by-side
instead of one after the other (that is, output will resemble
<code>pdbdiff</code> instead of <code>diff</code>). This setting is only applicable
for detailed output. 
</dl>

     <br><dt><code>$exclude</code><dd>The <code>diff</code> function normally recurses into directories and compares
the contents of those directories. However, the <code>$exclude</code> variable
can be a list of character strings which specify object names and/or
types which should be excluded from recursive comparison.  The object
names may include shell wildcards such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[]</span></samp>&rsquo;. If a name pattern is relative (doesn't start with a slash) it
will be compared to the base name of the objects about to be
differenced; but if the name pattern is absolute (begins with a slash)
it will be compared to the full path names of the objects being
differenced. If the <code>$exclude</code> string begins with the string
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">type:</span></samp>&rsquo; then the following part should be one of the object types
printed by the <code>ls</code> function.  A difference operation between two
objects is suppressed if either object matches any of the strings stored
in the <code>$exclude</code> list.

     <p>For example, to prevent <code>diff</code> from comparing any objects with the
base name &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cycle</span></samp>&rsquo;, or any objects whose full name is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/VM/typelist</span></samp>&rsquo;, or any objects whose name ends with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_list</span></samp>&rsquo;,
or any object of type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">obj</span></samp>&rsquo; one would issue the following browser
command:

     <pre class="example">          &gt; $exclude = {"cycle", "/VM/typelist", "*_list", "type:obj"}
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">or invoke the browser with the switch
     <pre class="example">          --exclude='cycle,/VM/typelist,*_list,type:obj'
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>$diff_int8_abs</code><dt><code>$diff_int8_rel</code><dt><code>$diff_short_abs</code><dt><code>$diff_short_rel</code><dt><code>$diff_int_abs</code><dt><code>$diff_int_rel</code><dt><code>$diff_long_abs</code><dt><code>$diff_long_rel</code><dt><code>$diff_float_abs</code><dt><code>$diff_float_rel</code><dt><code>$diff_double_abs</code><dt><code>$diff_double_rel</code><dd>These variables control how the <code>diff</code> function determines whether
two numeric values are the same or different. The ones that end with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_abs</span></samp>&rsquo; specify the maximum absolute difference allowed between two
values <var>a</var> and <var>b</var>.  The <code>diff</code> command considers <var>a</var>
and <var>b</var> to be different if &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|</span><var>a</var><span class="samp">-</span><var>b</var><span class="samp">|&gt;</span><var>abs</var></samp>&rsquo;. 
The variables that end with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_rel</span></samp>&rsquo; specify the maximum absolute
difference relative to the mean of two values.  The <code>diff</code> command
considers <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> to be different if
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|</span><var>a</var><span class="samp">-</span><var>b</var><span class="samp">|/|</span><var>a</var><span class="samp">+</span><var>b</var><span class="samp">| &gt; </span><var>rel</var><span class="samp">/2</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>If both tests are performed then <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> are considered
different if either test indicates they are different. If an <var>abs</var> or
<var>rel</var> parameter is not defined (or has a non-positive value) then
the corresponding test is not performed. If neither test is performed
then an exact comparison is used.

     <p>All <code>diff</code> variables have a default value of zero and are set by
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--absolute</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--relative</span></samp>&rsquo; command-line switches.

<h3 class="section">5.2 Output Variables</h3>

     <dl>
<dt><code>$height</code><dd>The height of the output terminal in lines. If set to a positive value
then the browser will pause after each screenful of interactive output
(redirected output is unaffected by this setting). This variable is set
by the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--height</span></samp>&rsquo; command-line switch and is reset whenever the
browser receives a window size change signal (<code>SIGWINCH</code>).

     <br><dt><code>$width</code><dd>The width of the output terminal in characters. The browser will try not
to print data which would wrap from one line to the next. This variable
is set by the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--width</span></samp>&rsquo; command-line switch and is reset whenever
the browser receives a window size change signal (<code>SIGWINCH</code>).

     <br><dt><code>$verbosity</code><dd>This variable is set by the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--quiet</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--verbose</span></samp>&rsquo;
switches. The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--quiet</span></samp>&rsquo; sets it to zero while &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--verbose</span></samp>&rsquo; sets
it to two (the default is one). Changing its value at runtime changes
the amount of chatter produced by the browser.

     <br><dt><code>$truncate</code><dd>If this variable holds a non-negative integer value <var>N</var>, then the
browser shows only <var>N</var> values of each array; otherwise all values of
an array are displayed. Values which are omitted are indicated by a
string such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">...(2000 values omitted)...</span></samp>&rsquo; appearing at the point
where the values were omitted. Truncation is disabled (all values are
printed) by setting this variable to nil (its default).

     <br><dt><code>$trailing</code><dd>If this variable holds a positive integer value and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$truncate</span></samp>&rsquo;
has a non-negative integer value, then up to <var>n</var> of the printed
array values will come from the end of the array rather than the
beginning. The default value is 50.

     <br><dt><code>$fmt_double</code><dd>This variable holds a <code>printf</code> format string which is used to
format C <code>double</code> values.  The default value is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%1.10g</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>$fmt_float</code><dd>This variable holds a <code>printf</code> format string which is used to
format C <code>float</code> values.  The default value is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%1.5g</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>$fmt_int</code><dd>This variable holds a <code>printf</code> format string which is used to
format integer values.  The default value is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%d</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>$fmt_long</code><dd>This variable holds a <code>printf</code> format string which is used to
format long integer values.  The default value is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(long)%ld</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>$fmt_null</code><dd>This variable holds a <code>printf</code> format string which is printed for
null character strings.  The default value is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(null)</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>$fmt_int8</code><dd>This variable holds a <code>printf</code> format string which is used to
format 8-bit integer values.  The default is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(int8)%d</span></samp>&rsquo; but people
often like to change it to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">`%c'</span></samp>&rsquo; to see the ASCII equivalent. Be
warned that output of non-printable ASCII characters in this manner may
not work if the terminal emulator interprets them as commands.

     <br><dt><code>$fmt_short</code><dd>This vairable holds a <code>printf</code> format string which is used to
format short integer values.  The default value is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(short)%d</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>$fmt_string</code><dd>This variable holds a <code>printf</code> format string which is used to
format character string values.  The default value is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\"%s\"</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>$obase Output of primitive data (integer, character, string, and</code><dd>floating-point), by default, uses the <code>$fmt_</code> variables described
above. However, by setting this variable to 16, 8, or 2 it is possible
to display primitive data in hexadecimal, octal, or binary format.

<h3 class="section">5.3 File Variables</h3>

     <dl>
<dt><code>$pubinit</code><dd>This variable holds the name of the public initialization file and is
intended to be used as the first argument to the `include' function in a
user-private initialization file.

     <br><dt><code>$lowlevel</code><dd>If this variable has any true value (nil, zero, and the empty string are
considered false), then the browser reads objects as type
<code>DBobject</code> even if that object has some other datatype such as
<code>DBquadvar</code>.  This variable is set by the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-l</span></samp>&rsquo; command-line
option and is useful for debugging the low layers of Silo. The default
value is zero.

     <p>If the value is two or higher then the Silo definition of <code>DBobject</code>
is used and the values of the <code>comp_names</code> and <code>pdb_names</code>
arrays become part of the object.

     <p>If the value is one or two then the browser translates the Silo
<code>DBobject</code> structure into a structure which is more user friendly
by adding additional members to the object structure. Each member has a
name from the <code>comp_names</code> array and a value based on the
corresponding member of the <code>pdb_names</code> array<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a>.

     <br><dt><code>$checksums</code><dd>If this variable has any true value (nil, zero, and the empty string are
considered false), and the database being read includes checksums, then
the browser performs checksum checks during read. Note that currently,
the only Silo driver that supports checksums is the HDF5 driver.

     <p>If checksum checks are disabled, then if browser encounters corrupt data,
it will not know it. In particular, if checksums are disabled, the diff
operator can wind up reporting corrupted data as diffs. If checksums are
enabled, however, and the database being read includes checksums, then
browser will report errors when it encounters corrupt data and fail to
read the associated Silo object. See the associated Silo call
<code>DBSetEnableChecksums()</code> for more information.

     <br><dt><code>$rdonly</code><dd>If this variable has any true value (nil, zero, and the empty string are
considered false), then the browser opens files in read-only mode
instead of read-write mode.  Editing will not work on a file open for
reading only.

<h2 class="chapter">6 Initializing the Browser</h2>

<p>When the browser starts, it looks for a file called <samp><span class="file">.browser_rc</span></samp>
in the user's home directory or a file called
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local/include/browser_rc</span></samp><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-3" name="fnd-3"><sup>3</sup></a>.  However, an
alternate startup file can be specified with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--file</span></samp>&rsquo; browser
command-line switch.  The browser reads and executes each command found
in the startup file.

   <p>The startup file should contain an assignment to the
<code>$browser_version</code> variable which will be used to check that the
version of the startup file is appropriate for the browser being
run. Mismatched version numbers result in a rather verbose warning
message (provided that the browser was even able to process the startup
file).

   <p>The <code>$browser_version</code> number should be assigned some real constant
like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3.004</span></samp>&rsquo; where &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3</span></samp>&rsquo; is the browser major version number and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">004</span></samp>&rsquo; is the browser minor version number.  To determine what
version number to specify, invoke the browser as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">browser
--version</span></samp>&rsquo;.

<h2 class="chapter">7 Editing Database Objects</h2>

<p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>&rsquo; operator can be used to set the value of an internal
browser variable or to change the value of a database object.  If the
left hand side of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>&rsquo; is an internal variable, then the value
of the internal variable is changed. Otherwise if the left hand side is
a database object, its value is changed.  Otherwise, a new internal
variable is created and assigned an initial value.

   <p>The browser can change values for objects of type <code>DBobject</code> (most
objects are of this type if the browser is running in low-level mode) or
objects under the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">var(s)</span></samp>&rsquo; category in a directory listing.

   <p>When changing the value of a string database object like
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_fileinfo</span></samp>&rsquo;, the new value will be truncated to the same length as
the old value because of limitations in the underlying Silo database
drivers.  This does not apply to string fields of a <code>DBobject</code>.

   <p>Assigning a scalar value to an array or slice of an array results in all
selected elements of the array to be set to the same value.  For
instance, if the type of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">u_data</span></samp>&rsquo; is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[31, 41, 31] float</span></samp>&rsquo; then
the statement `u_data[5]=0' sets all elements of &ldquo;row&rdquo; five to zero.

<h2 class="chapter">8 Paging</h2>

<p>The browser keeps track of how many lines of output have been displayed
for the currently executing command and temporarily pauses that command
whenever output is about to scroll off the top of the screen.  The
height and width of the screen is determined by the browser making
certain <code>ioctl</code> calls at startup and each time it gets a
<code>SIGWINCH</code> signal.  The initial values can be set with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--height</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--width</span></samp>&rsquo; command-line switches.  If the
appropriate <code>ioctl</code> is not available then the values of environment
variables <code>LINES</code> and <code>COLUMNS</code> will be used. If all else
fails then the browser uses zero for the number of lines (that is, no
paging of output) and 80 for the number of columns.

   <p>When the browser pauses the output, the message &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">more? ('q' to
quit)</span></samp>&rsquo; is displayed. The following user responses are recognized:

     <dl>
<dt><b>Quit</b><dd>Cancels the command and returns to the browser prompt. This is
equivalent to the browser receiving a <code>SIGPIPE</code> signal.

     <br><dt><b>Continue</b><dd>Pressing the EOF key (usually control-&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">d</span></samp>&rsquo;) causes the command to
continue without being paged. Output will simply scroll off the screen).

     <br><dt><b>Next Diff</b><dd>Pressing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo; causes output to be suspended until the next file
difference report or the next non-diff command.

     <br><dt><b>Interrupt</b><dd>Pressing the interrupt key (usually control-&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>&rsquo;) causes the command
to be interrupted as usual. 
</dl>

   <p>Output redirected to a file or command is not paged.  If the user is not
satisfied with the limited paging ability of the browser, the output
from a command can be redirected to the pager of the user's choice using
output redirection.

<h2 class="chapter">9 Redirection</h2>

<p>Output from any browser command can be redirected to a file or shell
command by appending a redirection character and file name or shell
command to the end of the command.

   <p>To save the output of a command in a file, destroying the previous
contents of the file if any, append a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; and the name of the
file.  Unless the file name looks like a browser symbol it must be
enclosed in quotes.  For instance, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">quadvar3d &gt; saved</span></samp>&rsquo; saves the
value of Silo database variable &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">quadvar</span></samp>&rsquo; in a text file named
<samp><span class="file">saved</span></samp>.

   <p>To append the output of a command to a file, append a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; and the
file name to the end of the command.  Unless the file name looks like a
browser symbol it must be enclosed in quotes.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">typeof
quadvar3d &gt;&gt; saved</span></samp>&rsquo; appends type information to the <samp><span class="file">saved</span></samp> file.

   <p>To send the output of a browser command to the standard input of a shell
command, follow the browser command with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|</span></samp>&rsquo; followed by the
shell command in quotes.  The quotes are not necessary if the shell
command is a single symbol.  Since paging is disabled when output is to
a shell command, one way to display a result without paging is to pipe
the output through the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cat</span></samp>&rsquo; command like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">d | cat</span></samp>&rsquo;.

<h2 class="chapter">10 Interrupts</h2>

<p>Since some commands may require a long time to execute or produce a huge
amount of output, the user may want to abort the command before it
finishes.  If the output is paged interactively to the screen then
pressing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">q</span></samp>&rsquo; at the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">more?</span></samp>&rsquo;  prompt accomplishes
this.  Otherwise the user can press the interrupt character (usually
control-c) and the browser command will be immediately terminated and
the browser will prompt for the next command.  If the interrupt
character is typed during command input the browser itself terminates.

   <p>If output from a browser command is being piped into a shell command and
the shell command exits (or closes its standard input) before the
browser command is finished, the browser command gets the <code>SIGPIPE</code>
signal and terminates.

<h2 class="chapter">11 Examples</h2>

<p>This chapter contains some sample output from the browser.

   <p>Normally, you will specify the name of a database file on the browser
command-line<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-4" name="fnd-4"><sup>4</sup></a> like in the following
example, and sometimes it's convenient to open multiple files at the
same time.  Each file name listed on the command-line is given an
identifier like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$1</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$2</span></samp>&rsquo;, etc., and most of the browser
commands operate on file &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$1</span></samp>&rsquo; by default.

<pre class="example">     % <b>browser rect3d.pdb</b>
     INFO: opening `rect3d.pdb' as $1
</pre>
   <p>The <code>ls</code> command is similar to the Unix <code>ls</code> command in that
it lists the contents of the current working directory.  The heading
fields on the left of the equal signs apply until the next heading.  The
headings are the same as those used by MeshTV.  To list the contents of
some subdirectory, say &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ls</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ls dir1</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">print dir1</span></samp>&rsquo;, or just &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">dir1</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>To keep the size of these examples small, we've specified that at most
50 values should be printed from each array and that 25 of those values
should be from the end of the array (and the other 25, from the
beginning).  To truncate everything say &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$truncate=0</span></samp>&rsquo; and to turn
truncating off say &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$truncate=nil</span></samp>&rsquo;.

<pre class="example">     &gt; <b>$truncate = 50</b>
                       = 50
     &gt; <b>$trailing = 25</b>
                       = 25

   <p>The user can ask for the type of any object, including types built into
the browser.  If the object is a structured type (like in this example)
then the type of each component of that structure is printed.

<pre class="example">     &gt; <b>typeof d</b>
                       = struct DBquadvar {
     id                =    +0 int

     dtime             =    +24 double
     meshid            =    +32 int

     nels              =    +44 int

     mixlen            =    +128 int
     use_specmf        =    +132 int (on/off)

                       = }
</pre>
   <p>An integer following a plus sign indicates that the type corresponds to
a byte offset from the beginning of the innermost enclosing structure
or array.

   <p>A &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; means the object is a pointer to whatever type
follows<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-5" name="fnd-5"><sup>5</sup></a>.

   <p>A list of array dimensions between &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo; mean that the
object is an array and each element of the array is the type that
follows the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The final name is always one of the browser integral types &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">string</span></samp>&rsquo;
(same as the C &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">char*</span></samp>&rsquo;), &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">short</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">int</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">long</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">float</span></samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">double</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If the integral type name is followed
by parentheses then the parentheses contain the name of an underlying C
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">enum</span></samp>&rsquo; type or a set of related C preprocessor constants.

   <p>Some data objects override one or more standard class methods.  Such
objects will have flags like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">__</span><var>flag</var><span class="samp">__</span></samp>&rsquo; which appear inside
the object type.

   <p>One can also ask for the Silo definition of a named data type like
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">DBquadvar</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This prints the definition of the Silo
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">DBquadvar</span></samp>&rsquo; structure which is the same as printed above for the
type of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">d</span></samp>&rsquo; except that array sizes and some primitive types are
not bound to actual values yet<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-6" name="fnd-6"><sup>6</sup></a>.

<pre class="example">     &gt; <b>DBquadvar</b>

   <p>The browser does not attempt to be efficient about loading objects from
the database into memory since the underlying Silo library makes it
difficult to do so.  However, if one says &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$lowlevel=1</span></samp>&rsquo; then the
browser uses lower-level Silo functions to read the file.  As a result,
less data is moved from disk to memory.

   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">diff</span></samp>&rsquo; command compares two objects and reports differences
between them.  The output is in groups of differences where the group is
delimited at the beginning and end by a line of stars.  The first half
of the group displays (part of) the first argument to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">diff</span></samp>&rsquo; while
the part of the group after the line of dashes displays (part of) the
second argument.  Subobjects that differ only partially (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">stride</span></samp>&rsquo; in
this case) appear separately before those which completely differ.  The
array truncating parameters apply to each array segment individually.

   <p>A compound array is composed of zero or more subarrays.  A subarray can
be printed by saying something like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">carray.b</span></samp>&rsquo;, but a subarray is
also printed by saying just &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; as long as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; is not some
other type of object and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo; exists in exactly one compound array.

   <p>If the file is opened for reading and writing (the default) then
variables can be given new values.  The new values are written back to
the file immediately.

<pre class="example">     &gt; <b>_fileinfo</b>

   <p>A scalar variable assigned to an array (or slice of an array) sets all
the elements of that array (or slice) to the specified value.  A list of
values enclosed in curly braces can be assigned to an array (or slice of
an array) causing each element of the array (or slice) to be set to one
of the listed values.

<pre class="example">     &gt; <b>typeof v_data</b>
                       = [31, 41, 31] float
     &gt; <b>v_data = 0</b>

   <p>Pressing control-c during a browser command aborts the command, but
pressing control-c when the browser is asking for input aborts the
browser.  It is more polite to press control-d or type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">exit</span></samp>&rsquo;
instead since this gives the browser a chance to properly close database
files.

<pre class="example">     &gt; <b>$truncate = nil</b>

     <b>control-c</b>

<a name="texinfo-footnotes-in-document"></a><h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> In contrast, pressing the
interrupt character during an interactive browser command aborts the
command but not the browser.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-2" href="#fnd-2">2</a>]</small> Changes
should not be made to the <code>comp_names</code> or <code>pdb_names</code> arrays
since the Silo <code>DBobject</code> is regenerated from the user-friendly
fields before being saved back to the file.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-3" href="#fnd-3">3</a>]</small> The path name may be
different depending on how the browser was compiled.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-4" href="#fnd-4">4</a>]</small> Opening a file on the command line is the same as
saying &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">open "rect3d.pdb" $1</span></samp>&rsquo; interactively.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-5" href="#fnd-5">5</a>]</small>  Whether or not something is a pointer is generally not
important to using the browser: a 1d array of pointers to 1d arrays of
integers can be treated like a ragged-edge 2d array of integers.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-6" href="#fnd-6">6</a>]</small> The word &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">self</span></samp>&rsquo; refers to the
